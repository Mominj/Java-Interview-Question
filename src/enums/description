The Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants.

Enums are used to create our own data type like classes

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters:

Points to remember for Java Enum
Enum improves type safety
Enum can be easily used in switch
Enum can be traversed
Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
