Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

polymorphism means ability to take more than one form. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances.
The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.
The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.

Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks.
Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.

In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. Real life example of polymorphism, a person at a same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at a same time is a father, a husband, a employee. So a same person posses have different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
⦁	Compile time polymorphism:
    --->Function Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
    --->Operator Overloading: C++ also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’)
     for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add to operands.
     So a single operator ‘+’ when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.

     java do not support operator overloading.

⦁	Run time Polymorphism:
   --->Function overriding: on the other hand occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
Dynamic Binding:
In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support this.
