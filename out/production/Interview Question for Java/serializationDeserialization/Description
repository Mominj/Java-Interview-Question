Serialization and Deserialization:

Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.
This mechanism is used to persist the object.

Advantages of Serialization
1. To save/persist state of an object.
2. To travel an object across a network.
